# RNNexp

## Prerequisites

Install [NeuralModels](https://github.com/asheshjain399/NeuralModels)

## Description

This repo contains the source code for the following papers:
* Structural-RNN (S-RNN) for doing deep learning over spatio-temporal graphs.  Checkout the [srnn](https://github.com/asheshjain399/RNNexp/tree/srnn/structural_rnn) branch and the source code is present in the directory structural_rnn. This source code takes input a spatio-temporal graph written in a text file and creates the S-RNN architecture. Currently the directory contains the code for human motion modeling on H3.6m data set. Our paper can be downloaded from [here](http://asheshjain.org/srnn)

* Sensory-fusion recurrent neural architecture for driver activity anticipation http://brain4cars.com The source code is in the directory anticipatory-rnn/maneuver-rnn. **Checkout 'icraversion' branch of [NeuralModels](https://github.com/asheshjain399/NeuralModels/tree/icraversion) to reproduce our results**. 

* S-RNN for modeling human-object interaction (human activity detection and anticipation) code is present in anticipatory-rnn/activity-anticipation. Our paper can be downloaded from [here](http://asheshjain.org/srnn)
